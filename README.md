This project is an interactive time-series prediction tool using neural networks (LSTM and MLP) for regression tasks. It predicts future values from any numerical dataset provided by the user, offering flexibility to work with various data sources. The tool, built with Streamlit, includes features to preprocess data, train models, and visualize results through prediction plots, loss curves, and accuracy metrics.
